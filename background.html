		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>Trends in fungal diversity have been found based on large scale studies in urban environments.  Fungal communities can be disturbed by chemical pollution.  Polluted environments favor saprotrophic fungi (fungi that gather their nutrients from dead organic material) compared to ECM fungi (fungi that are in symbiosis with tree roots).  This means that diversity is affected by chemical pollution.  Although research exists on this it is relatively lacking and my proposed study would provide a whole city's worth of data to prove or disprove this. (Newbound, 2010)                                      
Some studies have been done in this area  (Lawrynowicz, 1982) (Newbound, 2010) but the knowledge of fungal trends within cities is overall lacking especially as cities are rapidly expanding.  Some have been done asking citizens, others have used technology to capture spores in the air (Abrego, 2020), my study is based on what is beneath the soil. 
                         
                                                 
What are the different types of fungi that exist within Portland?How are the fungi distributed throughout Portland?
