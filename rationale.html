		<h1>Rationale</h1>
		<p>The questions I will be examining feature the city of Portland and its relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.  How many different types of fungi are included within Portland's metro area and where are they located?                  
                                         
                                             
What are the different types of fungi that exist within Portland?                How are the fungi distributed throughout Portland?
     These questions are designed to provide information on how urban development and human activities affect mycorrhizal fungi.                           
My hypothesis is that areas of human disturbance and urbanization will have less fungi and less variation in fungi.                          
                                                     
     If my hypothesis is confirmed it will show that trends in other cities across the globe, where this has been studied, can be confirmed in the cities in the Northwest.                  
     If my hypothesis is disconfirmed It would mean that there exists a difference in fungal abundance trends when compared to studied cities outside of the US.    </p>
