		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p> To test my hypothesis I would first use available GIS (geographic information system) data showing public greenspace in Portland.  I would then use the available map to select sample cites from each piece of greenspace.  Using cameras and the naked eye, each sample site would be observed and any fungal life found would be categorized and recorded.  100 surveys would be spread out to random homeowners in each part of Portland resulting in 600 surveys total (North, North East, North West, South, South East, South West, East, West).  Participants would be selected using a random number generator and asked in person if they would like to participate. If they are unwilling, their neighbor will be asked instead. Each survey would ask the participant to search their property for naturally occurring fungi, and count the number of each type present.  Surveys would include images to help participants categorize the fungi they found.  Each survey would include an envelope with stamp and return address so results could be collected. Participants will be encouraged to complete and return their survey within 10 days. Collected data would be analyzed to discover which and how many of each fungal species are present and then would be mapped using GIS software.   			
Collecting data from public and private land helps provide a greater picture of fungal abundance in Portland. Choosing many samples to test from all over the city will give me the best possible look at fungal abundance and diversity trends throughout an urban environment as a whole.

		<h1>Design</h1>  										 	
Testing for PH levels and comparing results with known sources of pollution would allow me to further test my hypothesis. After surveys have been returned a number of  PH tests determined by the amount of returned surveys and green spaces will be done in each section of Portland. Locations of PH tests will be determined by Greenspace locations and the locations of surveyed homes.  						 						
Finding differences in fungal type and fungal abundance compared to sites of known pollution and human activity would allow me to prove/disprove my hypothesis.  If it was found that near places of pollution/concentrated human activity there existed less fungal abundance and/or a decrease in fungal diversity, my hypothesis would be found to be confirmed.  				 							 				
	I would need to have a control study focused on 2 small areas.  One having known human activity/pollution and the other being somewhere isolated without regular human interference. After taking samples from both sites a control can be made.  I would also measure PH levels in each to control for PH. Failing to do this properly could result in my hypothesis being wrongly confirmed or disconfirmed.

	<h1>Procedure</h1>		
Use GIS data to locate and map sample sites in greenspaces around Portland and select 600 random homes to survey, 100 in each part of portland.
Record and categorize fungi in each green space.
Pass out surveys to willing participants.   
Record results found on returned surveys.  
Determine locations for PH testing and conduct PH tests. 
Categorize data on a map using GIS software.  
		</p>
		<p>
 
<h1>Analysis</h>
 Analyze data to discover which fungal species are present
Analyze data to discover how much of each species is present and where.
Compare data with known data on pollution spots and hotspots of human activity.
Decrease in fungal diversity closer to places of pollution would confirm my results. 
Lack of change in diversity would disprove my hypothesis.
