		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p> To test my hypothesis I would first use available GIS (geographic information system) data showing public greenspace in Portland.  I would then use the available map to select sample cites from each piece of greenspace.  Multiple sample cites would be plotted from a single section of greenspace if said greenspace was over      meters in total square area.   Using soil push probes, cameras and the naked eye, each sample site would be observed, sampled, and recorded using photography, for signs of fungal life.  Collected data would be analyzed to discover which fungal species are present and then would be compared to known sources of pollution.              
 This method is simple in that it does not involve sampling from private land which would make the process take a lot more time and effort.  This method also includes multiple ways of data collection (above ground fungal observation and soil sampling). This provides additional data that includes more types of fungi.                                                 
     I have chosen many samples to test from all over the city which would give me the best possible look at fungal abundance and diversity trends throughout an urban environment as a whole.          </p>
