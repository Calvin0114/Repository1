		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p> My results would provide valuable data that would further confirm or disconfirm the theory that within urban environments fungal abundance is limited.  It would provide a city wide map of data that could be referenced for future studies and compared to existing ones.  My study would be the first city wide fungal abundance and distribution study of this kind done in a North American city and would provide a base ground for conducting future studies in American cities with similar climates and known fungal communities.              </p>
